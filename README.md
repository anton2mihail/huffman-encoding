# huffman-encoding
an encoder/decoder utility written in java



<b>To Encode</b><br/>
It takes the name of the program and the text file to encode as command line arguments 
and encodes it using the huffman technique, returning a text file of the same name with the extension '.cmp'

<b>To Decode</b><br/>
It takes the name of the program and the name of the text file with the extension '.cmp' as command line
arguments, and it returns the exact same file that was initially encoded with the extension '.dcp'
<br/>
<b>The text files included:</b><br/>
Including the '.dcp' files have been included as examples of text files to test. It is best to use this utility by first configuring the <a href="https://www.cs.colostate.edu/helpdocs/eclipseCommLineArgs.html">command line arguments</a> directly from eclipse.
